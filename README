qooxdoo OO
==========

qooxdoo OO provides the object oriented features of qooxdoo (http://qooxdoo.org) as commonJS module. The module is largely generated from the standard qooxdoo code base. 

State
=====

The module is still experimental. However basic functionality like "qx.Class.define" is working already.

Working features:
  * qx.Class.define
  * qx.lang.*
  * qx.core.Assert
  * Property data binding
  * Date format
  * Unit tests
  
Missing features:
  * dependency detection while importing qooxdoo code (still manual)
  * documentation (at the moment the unit tests are the only documentation)
  * async unit tests
  * i18n data
